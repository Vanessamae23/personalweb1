         <p> Coast is the zone where the land meets the sea </p>
         <p> Factors affecting coastal environments </p>
         <ol>
           <li> Waves : a rising and falling movement of the water surface. Main shaping force of the coastal environment
Formed when kinetic energy from winds blowing across seas and oceans is transferred to water surface
Greater wind energy - higher wave energy - stronger and taller waves - more power to shape the landforms </li>
           <li> Tides : daily alternate rise and fall in the sea level. Caused by gravitational pull of moon and sun on earth which produces an alternating low and high tide which changes every 6 hours
Tides affect processes such as coastal erosion, sediment transport, sediment deposition as it affects coastal area that can be reached by the waves
During high tide, waves reach parts of the coast that may not be subjected to wave action during low tide. Hence, waves erode and transport away larger parts of the coast
Intertidal Zone will have more erosion due to continuous drying and wetting </li>
           <li> Currents : large scale continuous movement of water in seas and oceans. Play role in distributing sediments and regulating temperature
Currents carry large amount of energy and shape coast through erosion, transportation, deposition
Regulate temperature - carry cool water away from North and South poles towards the Equator and warm water away from the Equator toward Poles
Helps create milder climates in coastal environment
Longshore current - nearshore current that flows parallel to the coastline </li>
           <li> Geology : the arrangement and composition of rock found in the area. Determines the hardness and their resistance to erosion
Affects the rate of erosion and the shape of coastline
Harder rocks (eg. granite and basalt) will erode more slowly than soft rocks (eg. limestone and shale
Granite and basalt (well-jointed rocks) are vulnerable to erosion when the joints are attacked by waves
Alternate layers of soft and hard rocks - more vulnerable to erosion </li>
           <li> Types of ecosystems : communities of plants and animals interacting with each other (eg. coral reefs and mangrove)
Reduce the impacts of waves on coast
Natural barriers against coastal erosion and flood
Coral reefs - provide natural barrier to slow down the speed and impact of waves on coast
Mangrove - help trap sediments and reduce coastal erosion, reduce the effect of floods and tsunami </li>
           <li> Human Activities
Built-up coastal areas alter coastline
Pollution of coastal environment from dumping waste
Affects the condition of the coastal environment </li>
